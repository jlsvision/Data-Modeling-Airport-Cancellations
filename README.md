The analysis of this project was to find the airline companies that had the most flight cancellations and around what time of the year they would occur the most. We chose to tackle this problem in order to avoid travel inconveniences that can cost you a lot of money and ruin your plan vacations. A co-founder of this project, Kwang Min Ko, shares the story of how he had to cancel his honeymoon plans because a flight was cancelled by an airline company.


# Dataset: API's and Kaggle of all U.S Flight Cancellations from 2015-2018.

This data set was created with the conjunction of API data from IATA Airports. We merged two data sets and were able to decode the airport using the API data. At the end of this data, we had a total data set of about million rows and columns. This data was very large because it over a 4 year time span. This meant we had to do a lot of data clean, normalization and cereating a database for such a large dataset.
