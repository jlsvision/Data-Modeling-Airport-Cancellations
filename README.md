# The Dilemma of Airline flight cancellations 

By: Jorge Sanchez, Abel Renteria, Kwang Min Ko 

The analysis of this project was to find the airline companies that had the most flight cancellations and around what time of the year they would occur the most. We chose to tackle this problem in order to avoid travel inconveniences that can cost you a lot of money and ruin your plan vacations. A co-founder of this project, Kwang Min Ko, shares the story of how he had to cancel his honeymoon plans because a flight was cancelled by an airline company.
